This is a simple C++ Command Line Parser.

It allows for creation of command line options with the following attributes:
- the command line option text
- help text related to the particular option
- mandatory flag
- default value, if option is not mandatory

Different CmdLineOption classes have been implemented depending on the
command line value as follows:
- CmdLineOptionStr
- CmdLineOptionInt
- CmdLineOptionFloat
- CmdLineOptionFlag
Ive considered making these templatized instead of seperate classes,
but dont see much benefit in doing so.

Mutual exclusive values can be created, by which only one of the
options can be specified on the command line.  Currently, only one
main mutual exclusion group can be created, but I would like to
have groups of mutually exclusive options.

Once all the options have been created, and optionally the max and
min number of cmdLine options set, simply call:
  CmdLineParser::parseCmdLine(argc, argv)
And all the parsing will be handled. To get the value for each option,
call the following:
  (CmdLineParser::getCmdLineOption(key))->getValue()
where the key is the command line option text.

Currently, no exceptions are thrown, (since we cant use exceptions
in our code here at work :( but I would like to possibly make
a conditionally compiled version with exceptions.

TODO
1) Mutual exclusion groups
2) Exceptions
3) Tests - currently refer to the usage in LoanCalculatorCpp
